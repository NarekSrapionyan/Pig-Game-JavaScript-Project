🎲 Hi there!

👋 Welcome to the Pig Game Repository!
This repository contains a fun and interactive two-player Pig Game, built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is simple but exciting—players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their round score and must pass the turn!

This project is great for JavaScript beginners, as it covers fundamental concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic game logic.

📌 Features:
🎲 Roll the dice to earn points.
🔄 Decide whether to keep rolling or hold your score.
🐷 If you roll a 1, you lose your current round points!
🏆 The first player to reach 100 points wins!

🎮 How to Play?
The first player starts.
Click "Roll Dice" to roll the dice.
The rolled number is added to your current score.
If you roll a 1, you lose your round points, and the turn goes to the opponent.
Click "Hold" to save your points and pass the turn.
